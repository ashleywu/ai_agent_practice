The OKRs (Objectives & Key Results): How do we define success?





Objective: Capture ideas with zero friction.





Key Result 1: The capture action must be a single, simple gesture.



Key Result 2: The entire process, from gesture to the AI receiving the audio, must be invisible to any outside observer.



Objective: Deliver a useful, actionable follow-up.





Key Result 1: The AI must accurately transcribe the audio.



Key Result 2: The AI must intelligently infer the core Aha! moment and perform a relevant background search. The result should be a concise note containing the original thought and the research summary.



Key Result 3: The latency from gesture to the final note being available for review should be under 2 minutes.
