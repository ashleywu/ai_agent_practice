The Core Problem: 

My online time is fragmented across frequent tab and context switches, making it difficult to objectively understand how my time is allocated and how long I can sustain focus on non-entertaining content. Without automated aggregation and classification, my end-of-day assessment is vague and unreliable.

The User & Context: 

The user is me. The primary context is at the end of the day, after spending long hours online for learning, job searching, and general browsing.

In this context, I want to be able to answer two fundamental questions with confidence:

How my online time was allocated between entertaining and non-entertaining content.

How long I was able to maintain sustained focus on non-entertaining content without interruption.

The goal is not real-time intervention or behavior correction, but retrospective clarity—being able to review my day with accurate, objective data rather than intuition or guilt-driven estimates.


The Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

What is the absolute simplest version that would still feel useful?

The MVP is a lightweight, fully automated browsing journey tracker that runs on my computer and:

Passively observes my active browser tabs and time spent on each,

Automatically classifies visited websites into entertaining or non-entertaining categories, and

Aggregates this data into clear metrics that quantify:

total time spent in each category, and

sustained focus duration on non-entertaining content.

The system should require zero manual input during usage and surface insights only at review time.



The OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)
Objective 1: Accurately track my online time with minimal friction

Key Result 1:
The system accurately tracks active browsing time, including seamless handling of tab switches and rapid context changes.

Key Result 2:
Browsing activity is captured automatically without requiring manual tagging, annotation, or intervention.

Objective 2: Reliably distinguish entertaining vs non-entertaining content

Key Result 1:
Websites are consistently and correctly categorized into entertainment or non-entertainment based on predefined rules or intelligent inference.

Key Result 2:
The categorization logic is transparent and auditable, allowing me to understand and refine how classifications are made.

Objective 3: Deliver a clear and interpretable daily summary

Key Result 1:
The system produces a daily dashboard that accurately summarizes time spent on entertaining vs non-entertaining content.

Key Result 2:
The dashboard includes a simple visualization (e.g., a bar chart) and a tabular breakdown that makes time allocation immediately understandable at a glance.
